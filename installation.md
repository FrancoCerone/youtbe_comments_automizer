## 🆘 Problems?

### If the extension doesn't appear:
1. Check that all files are in the same folder
2. Verify that "Developer mode" is enabled
3. Try reloading the extension (refresh button)

### If you see "Error: reload YouTube page":
1. **Reload YouTube** (F5)
2. **Use "🔗 Test Connection"**
3. **Wait for "✅ Connected"** before starting
4. **If it doesn't work**: Reload the extension at chrome://extensions/

### If the indicator shows "❌ Disconnected":
1. Reload the YouTube page
2. Wait for it to fully load
3. Click "🔗 Test Connection"
4. Make sure you're logged into YouTube

### JSON Format Issues:
- Make sure to use double quotes `"` not single quotes `'`
- Each comment should be a string in the array
- Use proper JSON syntax: `["comment1", "comment2", "comment3"]`
- The extension will validate your JSON in real-time
